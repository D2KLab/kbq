# KBQ
An intelligent agent that performs quality assessment and validation of knowledge bases

## Architecture

The package `KBQ` is composed of the following modules:

- `metrics`, which contains the abstract class *metrics* and the concrete classess *completeness*, *consistency*,*hpersistency*, and *persistency*;
- `sparql`, which ontains the script *queries* that extract summary statistics based on SPARQL queries;
- `scheduler`, which contains the script *apiScheduler* that perform periodic scheduling tasks;
- `rest`, which contains the scripts for quality assessment and validation rest apis;


## Instruction

KBQ is hosted on the website: 

If you want to run the webapp locally, you need to first clone the repository and then install the requirements:

```bash
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
$ python run.py
```
